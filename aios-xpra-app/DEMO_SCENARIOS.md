### Questions You'll Be Asked

A: "Screen Agent uses visual understanding, not hardcoded selectors. Minor UI changes don't break workflows. Major changes are detected and Screen Agent adapts."

A: "Every action is validated before execution. Screen Agent can pause for human confirmation on critical actions. Full audit trails for all operations."

**Q: "What's your moat?"**
