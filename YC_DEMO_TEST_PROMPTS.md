## 🎯 HOW TO TEST IN AIOS

### Method 1: Direct Input
1. Open your AIOS interface (http://localhost:10005)
2. Click in the chat/command box
3. Paste the prompt
4. Hit Enter
5. Watch the magic happen!

### Method 2: Via Socket.IO (if using custom UI)
```javascript
socket.emit('execute_task', {
  task: "YOUR PROMPT HERE",
  user_id: "demo_user"
});
```

### Method 3: API Call (for testing)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "YOUR PROMPT HERE"}'
```

---

## 🔍 MONITORING LOGS

Watch the live logs in your terminal:
```bash
docker logs -f aios_nelieo_phase1
```

Look for:
- ✅ `[SuperAgent]` - Task execution
- ✅ `[Vision]` - Screenshot analysis
- ✅ `[Gemini]` - API calls
- ❌ `ERROR` - Issues to fix
- 💰 `Cost:` - Budget tracking

---

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If a test fails:
1. Check logs for error messages
2. Verify screenshot capture is working
3. Ensure Gemini API key is active
4. Try simpler version of prompt
5. Check if app/site loaded properly

### Common Issues:
- **503 errors**: Gemini rate limiting (wait 6 seconds)
- **Screenshot timeout**: Xpra not ready (wait 10 seconds)
- **Task incomplete**: Prompt too complex (break into steps)
- **Wrong action**: Vision misinterpretation (adjust prompt clarity)

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS

Track for each demo:
- ✅ **Success rate**: Did it complete correctly?
- ⏱️ **Time to complete**: How long did it take?
- 💰 **Cost per run**: Actual API usage
- 🎯 **Accuracy**: Did it follow instructions precisely?
- 🔄 **Retry needed**: How many attempts?
